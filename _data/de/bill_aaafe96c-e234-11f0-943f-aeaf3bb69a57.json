{"legislative_session": "153", "identifier": "SB 208", "title": "AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 24 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSIONALS.", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "synopsis", "abstract": "This Act adds 2 additional psychology professionals regulated under Chapter 35 of Title 24: (1) a licensed psychology associate and (2) a master\u2019s-level psychological assistant. This Act also renames the psychological assistant registered under \u00a7 3509 of Title 24 to \u201cdoctoral-level psychological assistant\u201d to mark the difference in education between the existing psychological assistant and the master\u2019s-level psychological assistant added by this Act. This Act also changes \u00a7 3511 to clarify that licensing through reciprocity does not apply to individuals registered under \u00a7 3509 and \u00a7 3509A.\r\n\r\nA licensed psychology associate may independently practice at a master\u2019s-level of education and training, subject to the limitations listed under \u00a7 3508A(e) added by this Act. The Board of Examiners of Psychologists (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may grant a license to practice as a licensed psychology associate if an applicant meets certain qualifications, including holding a master\u2019s degree in psychology from an accredited school, completing an internship, obtaining at least 2 years of supervised professional experience, and achieving a passing score on a Board-approved examination. A licensed psychology associate is subject to the same standards as a psychologist licensed under Chapter 35 of Title 24, including handling of patient records, mandatory reporting, character and fitness requirements, and professional discipline. A licensed psychology associate also may be granted a license by reciprocity. \r\n\r\nAn individual who is seeking further licensure under Chapter 35 of Title 24 may register as a master\u2019s-level psychological assistant. A master\u2019s-level psychological assistant may perform specific functions, appropriate for the assistant\u2019s level of education and training, under the supervision of a licensed psychologist or licensed psychology associate. The supervising licensed psychologist or supervising licensed psychology associate may apply to the Board for registration of a master\u2019s-level psychological assistant and shall provide to the Board evidence that the individual presented for registration has the required master\u2019s-level of education and training, that the individual will receive appropriate training and supervision, that the individual meets character and fitness requirements. The supervising psychologist or licensed psychology associate must also give the Board a statement outlining the specific functions the master\u2019s-level psychological assistant will perform under supervision. The individual seeking registration must provide a statement, under oath, that the individual will not practice independently, will perform only the specific functions outlined in the statement submitted by the supervising psychologist or supervising licensed psychology associate, and will not represent that the individual is a licensed psychologist or licensed psychology associate. A master\u2019s-level psychological assistant is subject to the same professional standards and professional discipline as a doctoral-level psychological assistant. \r\n\r\nThis Act also makes technical corrections to conform existing law to the standards of the Delaware Legislative Drafting Manual. Technical changes include removing deadlines that have passed and are no longer relevant, changing language to increase clarity and consistency, and changing the structure of certain paragraphs to increase readability and organization. Additionally, to clarify that all applicants for licensure or registration under Chapter 35 of Title 24 must provide criminal background checks, this Act moves the provision requiring applicants to provide for fingerprints to obtain a criminal background report from \u00a7 3514 of Title 24 to the qualification requirements for each individual licensee or registrant under \u00a7 3508, \u00a7 3508A, \u00a7 3509, and \u00a7 3509A of Title 24.\r\n\r\nThis Act requires a greater than majority vote for passage because \u00a7 11 of Article VIII of the Delaware Constitution requires the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly to impose or levy a tax or license fee.\r\n\r\nThis Act is effective on its enactment and is to be implemented the earlier of the following:\r\n1. Twelve months from the date of enactment.\r\n2. Notice by the Board of Examiners of Psychology published in the Register of Regulations that final regulations to implement this Act have been adopted."}], "other_titles": [{"note": "short title", "title": "Psychology Professionals/Add/Rename"}], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Introduced and Assigned to Legislative Oversight & Sunset Committee in Senate", "date": "2025-12-18", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Legislative Oversight & Sunset", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Brian Pettyjohn", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Brian Pettyjohn\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Marie Pinkney", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Marie Pinkney\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Claire Snyder-Hall", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Claire Snyder-Hall\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Valerie Jones Giltner", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Valerie Jones Giltner\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Sarah McBride", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Sarah McBride\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Cyndie Romer", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Cyndie Romer\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Franklin D.
